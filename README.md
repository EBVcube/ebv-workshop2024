# EBVCube workshop 14.10.2024 - 11 o'clock
Hands-on training on the EBVCube format for B-Cubed and Natura Connect partners.

## Installation
**Please do this before the workshop starts**
Use the 00_install_packages.R script to install all *packages* before the session. If you had problems come 30 min earlier to the session on 14th of October. We will help you :)

In case you don't have *R* installed yet, follow these steps (before running the script above):
1. Download R. [Here](https://cran.r-project.org/) you can find R.
2. Install an editor - it is really common to use RStudio to write R code as this editor is tailored to the R language. [Here](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) you can find RStudio - choose one based on your operating system.

[This post](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) guides you through the installation process.
